// 1. adaptive website has a fixed layout that adjusts towhat you are using. Responsive uses media queries to fir whichever screen it is displayed on.
// 2. when you first starting writing the code it is intened for phones or compuputers. Then you can go back later and put in @media.
// 3. allows us to have 1 rem equal to 10px.
// 4. gives us new features that aren't avaliable when using just CSS. You need a compiler to process everything.
// 5. My favorite part are the variables because they come in handy and make things easier. The hardest part for me is mixins because they don't make sense sometimes and are difficult.
